# GlobalWarmingNoMore

This tweak allows you to change the weather info in the stock iOS Weather app, as requested by /u/smacpats [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/cncza1/request_tweak_that_lets_you_change_the_values_in/). This tweak is verified to be compatible on iOS 12.2, but should also be working on iOS 11 and anything above (yes, that *should* include iOS 12.4).

Repository: **Team FESTIVAL** (https://repo.festival.ml)  
Price: **Free** (and also [Open Source](https://github.com/SniperGER/GlobalWarmingNoMore))  
Dependencies: **mobilesubstrate** (Cydia Substrate)  
Conflicts: **cy+model.ipad** (iPad)


## How does it work?
* Tap and hold on any *open* city in Weather to bring up the editor.  
* The editor is split into three sections: *Current Conditions*, *Hourly Forecast* and *Day Forecast*.  
* Tapping any item in *Current Conditions* allows you to directly edit its value. Changes appear when you tap **Done**.  
* Tapping any item in *Hourly/Day Forecast* allows you to edit a specific forecast's properties.  
* You can also undo your changes by tapping **Reset**  
* For extra fun, press **Randomize!**

## Known Issues
* Partial Translation: Only selected strings are found inside Weather.framework, others have to be translated manually. Currently, for some strings, there is only English and German available.  
* Swiping between cities doesn't work sometimes after the Editor view has been dismissed.

## Changelog
**1.0**  

* Initial Release  

**1.0-1**  

* Fixed temperatures being stuck when pressing "Reset"  
* Other minor improvements
